# Ransomware Resilience Assessment and Recommendation Tool User Guide

## Introduction
The Ransomware Resilience Assessment and Recommendation Tool is designed to help organizations evaluate their preparedness against ransomware attacks. This user-friendly application guides users through a series of questions to assess their current cybersecurity practices and provides actionable recommendations based on their responses.

## Getting Started
To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **User Interface**: The application will present a series of questions regarding your organization's cybersecurity practices. Answer each question to the best of your ability.

## Assessment Process
The assessment consists of three main stages:

1. **Pre-Infection**: Questions related to preventive measures, such as data backups and software updates.
2. **Active Infection**: Questions that assess your organization's response capabilities during an attack.
3. **Post-Infection**: Questions focused on recovery strategies and incident response planning.

## Scoring
After completing the questionnaire, the tool will calculate a readiness score based on your responses. This score reflects your organization's preparedness to handle ransomware attacks.

## Recommendations
Based on the calculated score, the tool will provide tailored recommendations to improve your organization's resilience against ransomware. These recommendations may include:

- Implementing regular data backups
- Enhancing network segmentation
- Establishing a comprehensive incident response plan
- Conducting regular software updates and patch management

## Interpreting Results
The readiness score will be presented along with a summary of your responses and the corresponding recommendations. Use this information to identify areas for improvement and strengthen your cybersecurity posture.

## Support
